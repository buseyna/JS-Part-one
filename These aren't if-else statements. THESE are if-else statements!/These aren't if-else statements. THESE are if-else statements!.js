//if statement you can add an else statement to provide code you wish to perform if the condition within the if statement is NOT true. The else statement is always tied to an if statement as it cannot stand alone. Here is an example of using an if and else statement:
var puppy = "Nermal";

if (puppy === "Spot"){
  alert("Hi Spot! You are so cute!");
}
else {
  alert("That's not Spot. Is that a cat??");
}
